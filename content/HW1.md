## My thoughts on AI

> 1. Buzzword 
> 2. Unstable
> 3. Futuristic
> 4. Hotdog or not a hotdog

These are the things that come to my mind when I hear artificial intelligence.

From a background of Computer Science, I feel that people tend to use "Artificial Intelligence" and "Machine Learning" as a way to make their products sound "futuristic" or "novel" when instead the affect that AI and ML have is either minimal or insignificant. At some point it can become easy to get cynical about the constant use of this term in startups and job opportunities.

### AI In my everyday life

Typically I find myself using the following websites/apps on my computer or phone:

> 1. Youtube
> 2. Spotify
> 3. Reddit

One thing that I love about youtube (and sometimes hate) is its algorithm. Thanks to "the algorithm" I have discovered many very interesting and obscure channels of varying topics, such as [Art Restoration](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvZe6ZCbF9xgbbbdkiodPKQ), [Theme Park History](https://www.youtube.com/c/Defunctland), and even [Tributes to Jim Davis](https://www.youtube.com/user/lasagnacat), the creator of Garfield. I always find myself looking forward to what new and interesting things are recommended to me in my feed and I feel that is what makes Artificial Intelligence special, in a way.

Here is a list of how social media affect other things within our daily life (from the Peoples Guide to AI worksheet)

Device or digital service with AI | AI Functions
--- | ---
Email Inbox | Filtering out spam
Check depositing | Image content recognition to allow for scanning of checks and getting key information to allow for faster deposits
Texting and mobile keyboards | Sentence completion and word correction technologies to help us compose messages faster.
Netflix | Recommending of shows and movies that match or are adjacent to our tastes
Google (search) | Adjusting our search results so that when we look something up we get provided with the most relevant thing.
Social media platforms | Help us discover posts similar to ones we've liked.
Automated message systems | Recognize our voices so customer service can be more automated before we have to talk to a human (to lower the burde).

### Benefits and Shortcomings of AI

I feel that AI can be incredibly helpful as it can automate a lot of our daily tasks and speed things up drastically for us. For instance, I don't have to type out those long words that I forget how to spell as well as don't have to think as hard when choosing TVs and Movies (although I probably take just as long as I would without AI)

On the other hand, AI can't do everything. Recently Github and OpenAI have come out with programming assistants that will predict what you are trying to write in multiple languages and give full recommendations with perfect solutions. This saves a ton of time spent googling and reading stack overflow posts, however there is a human component to development that the computer can't emulate. Being able to build a website from scratch given a description is something a computer could do, however debugging and fixing its own issues cannot be done strictly with AI and no human component.

Let's say I were to design an AI system to help with devops things such as setting up complex dev-dependencies in React apps (i.e. tailwind, eslint, prettier, etc.).

Prompts | Responses
--- | ---
What problem are you trying to address? | As a developer it is tedious to setup things such as tailwind and typescript in my apps. Having an assistant to do this would speed up my progress and remove my reliance on templates which may have setups that I am not too much of a fan of.
How can AI help solve this issue? | AI would be able to recognize how to add these configuratios into my application without me having to do so. As an added bonus it would be nice to have externally configurable files that can be shared among my projects (i.e. eslintrc, prettierrc, etc.).
What role will humans have in addressing this issue? | Humans will have to provide information to the AI regarding what they would like to add as well as what their default configurations are for their projects.
What data do you need to create an AI to help you address your issue? | I would need information from public repositories and to be able to know what license their repo is and what license mine is to prevent licensing issues that may arise.
How will you responsibly gather this data in a way that respects individuals' privacy and consent? | Using open source repositories would be the most straightforward way to do this. By keeping track of licensing it could alleviate issues with individuals and their issues.
